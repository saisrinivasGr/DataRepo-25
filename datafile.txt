To create a file in Git using the command line, one can utilize the touch command followed by
the desired filename and extension. For example, to create a text file named "newfile.txt", the command would be:
Code

touch newfile.txt

This command will create an empty file. To add content to the file, one can use the echo command:
Code echo "some text" > newfile.txt After creating and modifying the file, it needs to be added to the Git repository using the git add command:
Code

git add newfile.txt
Finally, the changes can be committed with a descriptive message using the git commit command:Code

git commit -m "Add newfile.txt"
git
